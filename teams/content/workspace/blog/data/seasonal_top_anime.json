Instead, he teams up with Choso to exorcise the countless cursed spirits unleashed by Noritoshi Kamo.\nAmid this chaos, the Jujutsu Headquarters revokes Yuji Itadori’s suspended death sentence and appoints special-grade sorcerer Yuta Okkotsu as his executioner. \nNewly awakened modern sorcerers and resurrected ancient ones,  now fighting as players in the Culling Game, collide with conflicting motives, driving the world once more toward an age ruled by jujutsu.\n(Source: TOHO Animation)",
